It's done! The [code](https://github.com/sumeetshirgure/DynamicPlanarHull) is up on my GitHub webpage.

All those days glued to lenny (my Lenovo laptop) were worth it.
Della would be proud too. (Guess who?)

I'll try to publish something if this is considered original.
Even though I feel like I rediscovered quite a bit of the details, there are
a few improvements over existing literature.
But I fear that the idea of supplying custom predicates as template parameters
is a brilliancy no print will appreciate.

But...
It works really well in practice and can be really useful should the need arise.
Once I write something of a report on the tool, I'll finally be done.


Update September 23: I'm thinking of integrating it with [CGAL](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/issues/7739)!
Hopefully they'll let me.

Update September 24: I've written a manuscript that I've submitted to ACM.

Update September 26: I could have submitted to [SoftwareX](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/softwarex) too.
I've a draft ready in case TOMS rejects me lol.

Update September 30: I've received feedback that my manuscript may be acceptable modulo some minor revisions. Yay.
