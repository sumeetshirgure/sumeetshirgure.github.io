I'm a [USC](https://www.usc.edu) alumnus where I got my Master's in Computer Science with honors.
However I was also quite involved with electrical engineering and quantum computing.

Before that I briefly worked remotely as a software engineer at Google's Bangalore offices.

I received my undergraduate degree from [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in).
Most notably I participated in ICPC style programming contests.
My teammates and I even ended up representing India at the [2019 World Finals](https://icpc2019.up.pt)
Here's my [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/Sumeet.Shirgure) profile.

I also interned once at Adobe, Noida as a deep learning researcher in NLP,
and once at D.E. Shaw, Hyderabad as a software engineer.

Linked are my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sumeetshirgure) and [Github](https://github.com/sumeetshirgure) pages you can follow me on.

Here's my [CV](/assets/pdfs/cv/Sumeet_Shirgure_CV.pdf).

I use [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) by the way.
