In a previous post I mentioned that I've run some experiments and come up with an algorithmic framework called "obfuscation".
I wrote a paper and submitted it to various NeurIPS workshops.
I also submitted it to the newly formed [TMLR](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/), where I hope they review it in time.

I contacted the unlearning challenge's team to ask for arXiv endorsements,
but their response times have seemed unsatisfactory so far.
They did reply when they thought that my findings were not accurate.
But after a rebuttal, not so much as a "we're looking into it", or "we think you're mistaken".
I've found this typical of Googlers, be it engineers or recruiters.

My (weak) guess is that the team is considering modifying the metrics of the challenge
to accomodate variations in the output distributions elicited by entropy regularization.
Or maybe I'm missing something. Or maybe they just don't care who knows.

I also tried asking professors and colleagues I know for endorsements, but no one seems interested.
So I've decided to forget about arXiv, and also to not care about anonymity -
i.e. I've posted the paper in the writings section, and will not be making any major revisions.

The tool I wrote for [dpch](https://zenodo.org/record/8396184) is in similar standing.
Peer review will take a long time, and it's much more advantageous for me to post it here so
that my future advisors and PhD hiring committees can appreciate them.
Moreover ACM and Elsevier journals require public access fees, and I'm not sure how public this blog will be considered.
Even the code is open sourced.
I'll wait a few ~~weeks~~ days before posting it here. ~~just in case they decide to accept it sooner than my PhD applications.~~

In other news, I believe I'm making some theoretical progress on low latency greedy decoding schemes for
topological quantum error correction.
(I'm not even trying to come up with clever titles for these blog posts. They just seem to come to me :D)
I'll also be giving a talk at the [theory group](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~cstheory/) at USC next week with previous work
and possible future directions. Hopefully this line of work turns into a paper as well.
