This is a retropost of me winning [QC Hack 2022's](https://www.quantumcoalition.io/qc-hack-2022)
Microsoft challenge and getting featured on their
[blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp/azure-quantum-challenge-at-qchack-2022-recap/).

I presented this work [[ppt](/assets/pdfs/presentations/qchack_2022.pdf)]
[[pdf](/assets/pdfs/projects/ee_520_project.pdf)]
to Microsoft's Azure Quantum team.

Thank you so much, [quantum coalition](https://www.quantumcoalition.io/), Mariia and Microsoft!
