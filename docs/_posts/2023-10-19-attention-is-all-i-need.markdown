I gave two talks "mini" talks today at the weekly theory lunch meetings at the group here at USC.
I've attached the pdfs in the writings section.
The work on entropy regularization and the NeurIPS unlearning challenge were somewhat well received.
However people weren't as interested in the implementation aspects of the dynamic planar convex hull.
Maybe it's because the audience was theory oriented.

Nonetheless, I was quite satisfied with the headcount and the attention I received for my work.
Working on a problem that no one else is interested in can be unrewarding at times.
Same goes for the peer review process.
I suppose paying someone to take a look at your obscure work might not be so unjustified.

In other news, I'm going to LA Philharmonic this weekend. They will be featuring Sibelius and Swan Lake.
I've listned to Hilary Hahn's violin concertos countless times on YouTube.
It will be exciting to see her perform live.
And I'm not too familiar with the work of Sibelius, other than Finlandia of course.
