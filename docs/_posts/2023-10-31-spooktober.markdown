It's been a while since I've made a post so here goes.

Firstly, I finally found a job!
I'll be joining the [RIKEN](https://dml.riken.jp/pub/ai_meets_qp/) group sometime next year.
They're doing some fascinating work with AI and quantum physics.
Although it appears that there's a long waiting time for Indian nationals. Big surprise.
At this point I'm just accepting that I spawned in hard mode. Much like death march in Witcher 3.

I've also been working on my personal essay in my PhD applications.
I'll probably link it after getting some feedback. Wouldn't want to sound like a _complete_ idiot.
It has something to do with spooky action at a distance, hence the name of the post.
That also meant totally skimping on my decoder project. I'll maybe do that later.

On the fun side of things, I went to the first (and possibly last) frat parties of my life.
It's a shame I didn't wear a costume for Halloween. Still, it was quite fun.
Also went to a potluck dinner. I brought samosas!

Lastly, in a surprising turn of events my paper actually got accepted at one of the NeurIPS workshops.
The initial reviews were underwhelming, and some other workshops straight up rejected it after not fully understanding it.
The team at Google also seem to not care -- they did respond incoherently but I didn't have the energy to get back to them.
Even TMLR desk rejected it.
It's a miracle now that I look back. Maybe the other submissions were even worse lol.
Guess I'm going to New Orleans this December.
